/**
 * Helper allowing to register shortcuts on the whole page.
 *
 * You may register keyboard and mouse shortcuts, like:
 *
 * ```
 * Ctrl+C
 * Shift+leftMouseClick
 * ```
 *
 * **Known limitations:**
 * Due to browser implementation, some shortcuts may not work.
 * For instance on a french keyboard layout, the shortcut "Shift+;" wont work as the browser
 * will return the result of the uppercase key that is "Shift+." in this case.
 * For alphanumeric keys the issue is prevented (this is the more needed feature).
